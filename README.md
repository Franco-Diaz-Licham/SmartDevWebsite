<a href="https://smartdev.com.au">SmartDev<a/> is a simple and elegant portfolio website for my freelance business to display my current projects and skills. It is a simple website built with vanilla JS/HTML/CSS and it uses bootstrap for some styling. The website displays information about how SmartDev startted, projects that were built as well as a way to contact me. This project used no frameworks and was based on a standard portfolio website found online for many developers.
