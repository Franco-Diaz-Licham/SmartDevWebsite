SmartDev website is a portofolio website for my freelance business to show my previous projects and skills. It is a simple website built in vanilla JS/HTML/CSS and it uses bootstrap for soem styling. The website displays information about projects that were built as well as a way to contact me. This project used no frameworks and was based on a standard portfolio website found online for many developers.
